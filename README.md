# MapX

MapX is a planned Windows/macOS desktop map workspace for China-focused users.

The V1 product direction is a Tauri + React app built around Baidu Maps online capabilities and local SQLite project data. The first release focuses on project-based point management before adding route planning, imports/exports, cloud sync, offline maps, or collaboration.

See the V1 product and technical specification:
